## What is this client/server magic?

The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.  
  
Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. 
 
A **server host** runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. 

A **client** does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests. 
  
Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are Email, network printing, music streaming services, social media, and pretty much the whole World Wide Web.
